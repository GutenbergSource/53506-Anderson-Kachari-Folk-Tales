<HTML><BODY>This bilingual book of Kachari (Bodo) folk-tales is a challenge, so I mark it as hard. The stories are collected from the Bodo-Kachari people who live in what is now the states of Assam and Meghalaya in N.E. India.

<p>This book is mentioned in the recently completed book on the Kachari's, and provides a good supplement to that book.

<p>Most of the text is the Bodo source next to an English translation in two columns. Since the Bodo is full of accents, there will be some serious work here in round P1; The English should be very straightforward.

<p>The first two pages include a comparison of the Bodo language with Assamese. With the Assamese on top, and the Bodo below. During the Formatting rounds, please handle them as follows: place each group of words between brackets, and place the phrase below it after a bar, for example, the well known French song we would handle as follows:

<pre>
[Frère Jacques,|Brother Jacob,] [frère Jacques,|brother Jacob,]
[Dormez-vous ?|Are you sleeping?] [Dormez-vous ?|Are you sleeping?]
[Sonnez les matines !|Ring the Matins bells!] [Sonnez les matines !|Ring the Matins bells!]
[Ding, daing, dong.|Ding, dang, dong.] [Ding, daing, dong.|Ding, dang, dong.]
</pre>


<p>The few fragments that appear in Assamese script (beautifully shaped characters with a connected top-line), can be proofread as [**Assamese] I will provide the transcription during PP.

<p>Please always use the -* notation for eol-hyphens in the Bodo text. It will be hard to resolve them without actually knowledge of the language, but I will use a "follow the majority" rule to resolve them if possible during PP, and otherwise let them stand. For that to work best, no arbitrary choices must be made before that.</BODY></HTML>
